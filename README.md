#### This repository contains three data science projects showcasing predictive modeling and analysis using machine learning techniques. Each project focuses on a different aspect of data science, aiming to solve specific problems and derive insights from the datasets used.

## **Projects Overview:**
## 1. Customer Churn Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier
#### Objective:  Predict customer churn for a telecom company using a decision tree classifier.

#### Description: This project aims to analyze customer behavior data and predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not. The decision tree classifier is utilized to create a model that predicts churn based on various features such as usage patterns, service subscription details, and customer demographics.

## 2. Spotify Genre Clustering
#### Objective: Group Spotify music genres into similar clusters based on their audio features.

#### Description: Using audio features provided by the Spotify API, this project employs clustering techniques to group similar music genres together. By analyzing attributes like tempo, danceability, and energy, genres are clustered to understand musical similarities and potentially aid in music recommendation systems.

## 3. Linear Regression for Estimating Used Cars Selling Price
#### Objective: Build a linear regression model to estimate the selling price of used cars.

#### Description: This project focuses on predicting the selling price of used cars based on various factors such as mileage, age of the car, brand, and model. A linear regression model is developed to estimate the selling price, providing insights into the relationship between different features and the car's price.
